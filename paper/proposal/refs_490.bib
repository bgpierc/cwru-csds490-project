	abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) modules are susceptible to manufacturing defects, mishandling problems or extreme weather events that can limit energy production or cause early device failure. Trained professionals use electroluminescence (EL) images to identify defects in modules, however, field surveys or inline image acquisition can generate millions of EL images, which are infeasible to analyze by rote inspection. We develop a rapid automatic computer vision pipeline (∼0.5 seconds/module) to analyze EL images and identify defects including cracks, intra-cell defects, oxygen-induced defects, and solder disconnections. Defect identification is achieved with a machine learning model (Random Forest, ResNet models and YOLO) trained on 762 manually-labeled EL images of PV modules. We compare model performance on an imbalanced real-world validation set containing 134 EL images and determine that ResNet18 and YOLO are the optimal models; we next evaluated these models on a dedicated testing set (129 module images) with resulting macro F1 scores of 0.83 (ResNet18) and 0.78 (YOLO). Using a field EL survey of a PV power plant damaged in a vegetation fire, we analyze 18,954 EL images (2.4 million cells) and inspect the spatial distribution of defects on the solar modules. The results find increased frequency of ‘crack’, ‘solder’ and ‘intra-cell’ defects on the edges of the solar module closest to the ground after fire. We also find an abnormal increase of striation rings on cells which were assumed to be caused mainly in fabrication process. Our methods are published as open-source software. It can also be used to identify other kinds of defects or process different types of solar cells with minor modification on models by transfer learning.},

	abstract = {Electroluminescence (EL) imaging is a useful modality for the inspection of photovoltaic (PV) modules. EL images provide high spatial resolution, which makes it possible to detect even finest defects on the surface of PV modules. However, the analysis of EL images is typically a manual process that is expensive, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge of many different types of defects. In this work, we investigate two approaches for automatic detection of such defects in a single image of a PV cell. The approaches differ in their hardware requirements, which are dictated by their respective application scenarios. The more hardware-efficient approach is based on hand-crafted features that are classified in a Support Vector Machine (SVM). To obtain a strong performance, we investigate and compare various processing variants. The more hardware-demanding approach uses an end-to-end deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that runs on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Both approaches are trained on 1968 cells extracted from high resolution EL intensity images of mono- and polycrystalline PV modules. The CNN is more accurate, and reaches an average accuracy of 88.42\%. The SVM achieves a slightly lower average accuracy of 82.44\%, but can run on arbitrary hardware. Both automated approaches make continuous, highly accurate monitoring of PV cells feasible.},

	abstract = {Automatic defect detection is gaining huge importance in photovoltaic ({PV}) field due to limited application of manual/visual inspection and rising production quantities of {PV} modules. This study is conducted for automatic detection of {PV} module defects in electroluminescence ({EL}) images. We presented a novel approach using light convolutional neural network architecture for recognizing defects in {EL} images which achieves state of the art results of 93.02\% on solar cell dataset of {EL} images. It requires less computational power and time. It can work on an ordinary {CPU} computer while maintaining real time speed. It takes only 8.07 ms for predicting one image. For proposing light architecture, we perform extensive experimentation on series of architectures. Moreover, we evaluate data augmentation operations to deal with data scarcity. Overfitting appears a significant problem; thus, we adopt appropriate strategies to generalize model. The impact of each strategy is presented. In addition, cracking patterns and defects that can appear in {EL} images are reviewed; which will help to label new images appropriately for predicting specific defect types upon availability of large data. The proposed framework is experimentally applied in lab and can help for automatic defect detection in field and industry.},
